# GA_Project
Our first project for General Assembly!

CryptoSeek, is a cryptocurrency research tool. It allows you to search the top 100 coins in the current market powered by the cryptoCompare api!

The website calls the api to display the top 100 coins displaying the name, symbol, current price and current marketCap!

There are three links in the navigation that lead you to numerous pages and websites to help you learn about the exciting world of blockchain!

Eventually links will be added to go to each coin.
<<<<<<< HEAD

My thought process was to get the data, publish in a table to show the current top 100 coins in the market. I had to call the api with ajax, create a loop that
not only created the rows and necessary data cells but also print out the data at the same time!

At first I had this problem where my loops created all the rows with whatever the specified number was, but it would also print out the data that same number of times.
I had two loops working under one functiion. The first was to create the rows and add them to the table body. The second loop was to create the data for the coins.
Two loops were one on top of the other. When I would execute them I had problems.
For example if I wanted it to create 100 rows of data, 100 rows would be printed, but the data would also grab 100 coins and print those 100 times but in each row!
I would have 100 rows filled with 100 coins in each row!

My soluton was to just create one loop that printed 100 rows along with the necessary data. It's a long block of code but it works.

Future plans that I want to implement? There are a lot of things that I'd like to add. I want to polish it up visually, There are a couple of things that I need to 
fix too. On the resource page the title of the website isn't white like it's suppose too. 
I want to add links for every coin that is produced so when the user clicks on them it brings them to a page bio of the coin. I want to add a search function that
allows a user to search a top 100 coin.
