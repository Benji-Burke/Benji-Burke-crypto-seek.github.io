# GA_Project
Our first project for General Assembly!

CryptoSeek, is a cryptocurrency research tool. It allows you to search the top 100 coins in the current market powered by the cryptoCompare api!

The website calls the api to display the top 100 coins displaying the name, symbol, current price and current marketCap!

There are three links in the navigation that lead you to numerous pages and websites to help you learn about the exciting world of blockchain!

Eventually links will be added to go to each coin.
